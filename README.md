# Higgs Signal Classification

In this repository you can find two machine learning models and a deep learning model, as well as the process followed to 
achieve a good classification between a signal process where new theoretical Higgs bosons are produced, and a background 
process with the identical decay products but with different kinematic features.

## The models
* ExtraTreesClassifier
* KNeighborsClassifier
* Neural network
